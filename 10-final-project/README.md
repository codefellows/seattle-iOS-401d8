# Project Week

# Project Week Overview  
> This week will be focused entirely on student projects. Students should have completed their project planning during the prior class and should be ready to start development on the first class of project week.

> Each project and the functionality involved is subject to discussion and all decisions are made based on a vote and majority rule. Also, all projects built at Code Fellows as part of project week are considered open source.

### Roadmap  
- Friday/Weekend: Plan, plan, plan...
- Monday morning: Finalize your Project Plan and share it with the instructional staff. We'll give you tips and pointers.
- Monday afternoon: Start building! Should try to get through an estimated **33%** of the apps MVP functionality.  
- Tuesday: Focus on core functionality. Should try to get through an estimated **66%** of the apps MVP functionality.  
- Wednesday: Strive for MVP being 100%
- Thursday: Focus on UI/UX, Documentation, and Stretch Goals.
> Instructors/TAs will be conducting mock presentations with each group throughout the day. This will mean that Instructor availability will be limited throughout the day.  

- Friday: Presentations!

So, you've decided on your final projects. Here are the guidelines that will determine how you operate over the next 7 days:

## Rules
Your team must adhere to the following requirements:

- **Each person must make meaningful contributions to the functionality of the project.**
- Each person must speak for a seemingly equal amount of time during presentations.
- Your application must have at least **10** Unit Tests with a minimum of **30** assertions.
- Your application must be deployed on a Device at the time of project presentations on Friday.
- You will have a daily individual project reports to submit via Canvas.
- Every project needs to have a well written and structured `README` for their documentation.
- Every day, each team needs to perform a daily standup to cover the following:
  - Where are we in the development process?
  - What is left to get to MVP(Minimum Viable Product) by Wednesday?
  - What do we need done by End Of Day.
  - based on the tasks left to complete, who will be taking on each task?

## Process

Here's the process that we'll be using for project week:

- During project week, your team must generally work on-campus so we can help whenever your team is stuck.
- At the start of each day, each team will do a 5-10 minute standup meeting, with a member/members of the instructional staff. 
- Each team should engage in user testing by inviting people to sit down and interact with your application. This will help your UI/UX immensely.  
- On the last day of project week, your team must present your project. Presentation guidelines will be available in the class repo for each day of project week.  

## Project Proposal

On the Friday before project week your team must submit a project plan to an instructor with the following information:
> This can be a simple google doc for simplicity.  

- Your team's name (if you want one besides what I set for you)
- Your team's members
- Your project's name and concept
- A diagram of your project's domain model
- An exhaustive explanation of how your team plans to address details in the problem domain
- Sketches/wireframes of your project's pages
- NOTE: You should not be writing any code prior to the submission of the project plan.
- TIP: Use pencil and paper to diagram and sketch. Online tools look snazzy but take some time to learn.

## Launch phase

Here are some suggestions on how to organize your team during the launch phase:

* Elect a Launch Driver who will be responsible for the following:
  * Driving the coding of the initial scaffolding phase.
  * Hosting the code under their GitHub account.
  * Setup Xcode File Groups for **Model, View, and Controller**. You may create, if you chose, additional groups for anything left in a "Grey Area" of MVC(Categories, Protocols, etc.)
* The rest of the team will be Launch Navigators and responsible for the following:
  * Navigating the coding of the initial scaffolding phase.
  * Staying one-step ahead of the Launch Driver by researching unfamiliar technologies and any frameworks the application may need.

Once all these pieces are wired up together, move on to the following.
- Initialize a new Git repository.
- Push it to GitHub and [add your team members as Collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/).

Make a plan, and work the plan!

## Development phase

Now that your project is launched, here's how to organize the development efforts of your team. Your goal is to have the entire work plan for the project planned and organized, down to the finest details, before you begin any coding:

* Use GitHub Issues, or a tool like waffle.io or Trello, to manage and divide up the work between your team members. This planning is essential and required for the project submission.
* Create new issues, issues that'll take an estimated 30 minutes to 2 hours (max!) to complete.
* Use labels and milestones as your team sees fit, but leave all newly created issues unassigned.
* **Assign an issue to yourself when you commit to working on it.**
* **When you finish an issue, make sure to move it through the process appropriately and take another task**
* Each feature should be built on its own branch. Think of each of the issues above as a feature.
* Once assigned, create a branch using a naming scheme such as the following:
  - Imagine issue '#1' is titled "UI for HomeViewController" and your initials are 'AW'.
  - The branch name would be `1_ui_home_controller-aw` or `1-ui-home-controller-aw`.
* Push the commits on your branch to GitHub regularly.
* Create a Pull Request for your branch even if you're unsure if it'll be merged into master.
* Ask someone else on your team to review the code in your Pull Request.
* If changes are required, make them on your branch and push them to GitHub for another review.
* Once satisfied, let the reviewer merge your Pull Request. Don't merge your own Pull Request.

## Presentation

On the last day of project week, your team will have 20-25 minutes to present your project.

- Each person goes around and introduces themselves first.  
- Then, have 1 person explain your project's problem domain and your team's solution.  
- Then, have a different team member explain the challenges that arose during project week and how your team overcame them.  
- Each person should handle part of the presentation. More details will be coming on this as we get closer to the day of presentations.  
- Each team will be given appropriately 30-60 minutes for a mock presentation with instructional team before the Final Presentations.  

## Grading
###Group Submission
Your group's grade will be an overall grade for your entire team based on your team's performance throughout the week.  
- This is not only based on the final product, but also how your team came together to complete it. Please refer to the rubric on canvas for more details.  

###Individual Submission
Your grade is based on your individual effort and your project's technical merit.

* Individual effort is graded based on **links to commits and Pull Requests** that demonstrate your contributions.
* Technical merit is graded based on the following criteria:
  * **Good and proper use of Objective-C**
    * Clear, readable, and efficient code
    * Contains no unused or unnecessary code
    * Well organized classes and types
    * Good naming conventions
    * Compiles with no warnings or errors
  * **Generally useful and functional**
    * Works as expected with no bugs

## Submitting this assignment

Please submit this Canvas assignment with answers to the following questions after your team's presentation:

- Describe your individual contributions to the team and project.
- Share links to commits or Pull Requests that demonstrate your contributions.
- What are you most proud of?
- What would have done differently?
- What lessons did you learn from this experience?


## Congratulations!

Thanks for all your hard work through this course! We can't wait to see where you go with your new mobile development wizarding powers. :)
