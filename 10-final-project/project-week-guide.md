#Project Week Overview  

> Each project and the functionality involved is subject to discussion and all decisions are made based on a vote and majority rule.

###Roadmap  
- Friday/Weekend: Plan, plan, plan...
- Monday morning: Finalize your Project Plan and share it with the instructional staff. We'll give you tips and pointers.
- Monday afternoon: Start building!
- Tuesday: Focus on core functionality
- Wednesday: Strive for MVP being 100%
- Thursday: Stretch goals, UI/UX, code cleanup, documentation, and rehearse presentations
- Friday: Presentations

You've decided on your final projects. Here are the guidelines that will determine how you operate over the next 7 days.

## Rules
Your team must adhere to the following requirements:

- **Each person must make meaningful contributions in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**
- Each person must speak for a seemingly equal amount of time during presentations.
- Your website must have at least 3 interlinked pages and clear navigation.
- Your website must accept and process user input.
- Your website must be deployed live on the Internet at the time of project presentations on Friday.
- You will have a daily individual project report to submit via Canvas.
- Every project needs to have a well written and structured `README` for documentation.
- Every day, each team needs to perform a daily standup to cover the following:
  - Where are we in the development process?
  - What is left to get to MVP(Minimum Viable Product) by Wednesday?
  - What do we need done by End Of Day.
  - based on the tasks left to complete, who will be taking on each task?

## Process

Here's the process that we'll be using for project week:

- During project week, your team must generally work on-campus so we can help whenever your team is stuck.
- At the start of each day, each team will do a 5-10 minute standup meeting, with a member of the instructional staff. 
- Each team should engage in user testing by inviting people to sit down and interact with your site. This will help your UI/UX immensely.
- On the last day of project week, your team must present your project, using the deployed version of the project. Presentation guidelines will be available in the class repo for each day of project week.

## Project Proposal

On the Friday before project week your team must submit a project plan to an instructor with the following information:
> This can be a simple google doc for simplicity.  

- Your team's name (if you want one besides what I set for you)
- Your team's members
- Your project's name and concept
- A diagram of your project's domain model
- An exhaustive explanation of how your team plans to address details in the problem domain
- Sketches/wireframes of your project's pages
- NOTE: You should not be writing any code prior to the submission of the project plan.
- TIP: Use pencil and paper to diagram and sketch. Online tools look snazzy but take some time to learn.

## Launch phase

Here are some suggestions on how to organize your team during the launch phase:

* Elect a Launch Driver who will be responsible for the following:
  * Driving the coding of the initial scaffolding phase.
  * Hosting the code under their GitHub account.
* The rest of the team will be Launch Navigators and responsible for the following:
  * Navigating the coding of the initial scaffolding phase.
  * Staying one-step ahead of the Launch Driver by researching unfamiliar technology.

**Once everyone is in agreement, here's how to launch a new project.** Build a basic scaffold, such as the following, from scratch ***as a team***:

- README.md
- LICENSE
- index.html
- any other HTML files go at this level
- css/
  - reset.css
  - style.css
  - style2.css, etc.
- js/
  - app.js
  - app2.js
  - app-data.js

Once all these pieces are wired up together, move on to the following.
- Initialize a new Git repository.
- Push it to GitHub and [add your team members as Collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/).

Make a plan, and get to work!

## Development phase

Now that your project is launched, here's how to organize the development efforts of your team. Your goal is to have the entire work plan for the project planned and organized, down to the finest details, before you begin any coding:

* Use GitHub Issues or a tool like waffle.io or Trello to manage and divide up the work between your team members. This planning is essential.
* Create new issues that'll take approximately 30 minutes to 2 hours (max!) to complete.
* Use labels and milestones as your team sees fit, but leave all newly created issues unassigned.
* Assign an issue to yourself when you commit to working on it.
* Each feature should be built on its own branch. Think of each of the issues above as a feature.
* Once assigned, create a branch using a naming scheme such as the following:
  - Imagine issue '#1' is titled "Add an about.html page".
  - The branch name would be `1_add_about_page`.
* Push the commits on your branch to GitHub regularly.
* Create a Pull Request for your branch even if you're unsure if it'll be merged into master.
* Ask someone else on your team to review the code in your Pull Request.
* If changes are required, make them on your branch and push them to GitHub for another review.
* Once satisfied, let the reviewer merge your Pull Request. Don't merge your own Pull Request.

## Presentation

On the last day of project week, your team will have 15-20 minutes to present your project.

- Explain your project's problem domain and your team's solution.
- Explain the challenges that arose during project week and how your team overcame them.
- Each person should handle part of the presentation. More details will be coming on this as we get closer to the day of presentations.

## Grading
###Group Submission
Your group's grade will be an overall grade for your entire team based on your team's performance throughout the week.  

###Individual Submission
Your grade is based on your individual effort and your project's technical merit.

* Individual effort is graded based on **links to commits and Pull Requests** that demonstrate your contributions.
* Technical merit is graded based on the following criteria:
  * **Good and proper use of HTML**
    * Clear, readable, and efficient structure
    * Uses semantic markup whenever possible
    * Contains no unused or unnecessary code
  * **Good and proper use of CSS**
    * Clear, readable, and efficient styles
    * Layout on various screen sizes like desktop and mobile
    * Well organized file structure.
    * Contains no unused or unnecessary code
  * **Good and proper use of JavaScript**
    * Clear, readable, and efficient code
    * Passes the linter
    * Global variables and functions are kept to a minimum
    * Responds to user events
    * Contains no unused or unnecessary code
  * **Generally useful and functional**
    * Works as expected with no bugs
    * Uses domain models to encapsulate data and behavior
    * Has at least 3 interlinked pages with a clear navigation, including an "About" page that tells us about each team member.
    * Has at least one page that accepts and processes user input
    * State (i.e. data) persists between page reloads
    * Deployed live on the Internet
