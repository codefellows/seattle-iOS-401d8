# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 10 - Twitter Clone  

## User Stories (MVP)  
 - As a developer, I want to utilize UIKit to build out an application to gain a working knowledge of Apple's primary UI framework.  
 - As an iOS developer, I want to design and implement a clean and delightful UI/UX, to improve my user's experience when using my Application.  

## Technical Requirements  
> These technical requirements are vague and fairly lightweight intentionally. This is to provide additional time to finish implementing any desired features or stretch goals into the application. Feel free to experiment and think up new features that you may think a user would like. The primary goal is submitting an application that looks, and feels, user ready. For the colors, fonts, layout, and view controller transitions, there is nothing wrong with using any of the Apple provided defaults. Apple and other companies use them often, in subtle ways, to achieve a clean, cohesive UI/UX.  

 * Continue to work from the same repository.  
 * Working on a non-master branch, called, `friday-cleanup` with regular commit history  
 * Implement a color scheme to your application to highlight different features of you UI. Also, you may *optionally* choose to include any additional assets you would like to use to improve the appearance of your UI.  
 * Find a font that is visually appealing and implement it into your application.  
 * Comb through and polish the layout of your views, buttons, and labels.
