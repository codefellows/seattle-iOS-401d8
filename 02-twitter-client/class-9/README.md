# Week 2 - Class 4
## Homework
* Implement a Simple Cache to check and see if an image you are about to download is already downloaded before doing a network call
* In `TweetDetailViewController.swift`:
	* Have an imageView that shows the user's profile image.
	* upon clicking on the person's image the app should push a 3rd UIViewController onto the stack.
* The 3rd view controller will show that user's timeline (the api url is "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/user_timeline.json?screen_name=" but you will need to add a parameter to this url.
* Convert your table view cells to use a Nib, so you can share the same cell for both the home time line VC and the user Timeline VC.
* Import an image asset into the asset catalog.
* Implement a UITableViewHeaderView on your `ViewController.swift` that displays the image added to the asset catalog.
