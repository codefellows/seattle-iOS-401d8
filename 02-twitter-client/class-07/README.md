# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 7 - Twitter Clone  

## User Stories (MVP)  
 - As a developer, I want to utilize UIKit to build out an application to help work towards a better understanding of Apple's primary UI framework.  
 - As a developer, I want to utilize the Accounts framework in order to access the User's accounts stored in the iOS Device.  
 - As a developer, I want to implement the Social framework into my application to provide an easier connection to the Twitter API through one of Apple's frameworks.  
 - As a developer, I want to understand multithreading, to better understand when to update UI as well as to better understand how to properly execute network requests.  

## Technical Requirements  
 * Continue to work from the same repository.  
 * Working on a non-master branch, called, `tuesday-lab` with regular commit history  
 * Implement a new class called `API`:  
 	* Use the Accounts framework to access the user's twitter account on the device  
 	* Use the Social framework to make a request to twitter for the users home timeline `Tweets`  
 	* Use the Social framework to make a request to twitter for logged in user and create your model `User` object  
 	* Use a ranged switch statement to make sure the status code of the response is good  
		* Make sure to have individual cases for the `400-499` range, and the `500-599` range. Each of these cases should `print()` their case specific errors(either that the error is from our client, or the error is happening server-side.)  
 * Reload the `tableView` on the main thread (aka: main queue) once you are done parsing the JSON data from the request.
 * Migrate the JSON parsing code from `getOAuthUser` to a type method on the `JSONParser` class.  
 * Make sure to properly handle any force `try!` code in our `API` class from lecture, using the `do`, `try`, `catch` format.  
#### Stretch Goals
 * Write your code to be able to handle multiple twitter accounts.  
 * Using playgrounds, and `OperationQueue`:  
 	* Demonstrate creating a serial queue.
 * Refactor your `typealias` completionhandlers, in the `API` class, to be an `Enum` holding each closure as an associated value.   

## Submitting Your Assignment  

1. When your work is complete and ready for submission, **open a Pull Request** from `tuesday-lab` to `master`.  
2. Submit the link to the above Pull Request to Canvas  
3. Add a comment to this Canvas submission with answers to the following questions.  
  - How did this lab go, overall?  
  - What observations or questions do you have about what you've learned so far?  
4. Once you've submitted your work, complete the merge of `tuesday-lab` to `master`
