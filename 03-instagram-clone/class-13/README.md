# Week 3 - Class 3  
## Homework  
* Build a call to CloudKit to get all images uploaded.  
* Create a GalleryViewController designed to show uploaded images.  
* Add a collection view to the interface.  
* Build a simple custom UICollectionviewFlowlayout to handle how the cells are displayed.  
	* Customize your Flow Layout, we will add a pinch gesture to this tomorrow.  
* Use property observers to set collection view cell's imageViews, when downloaded (lazy load images).  
* Refactor your Filters class to be a singleton.  
	* This new singleton should have 1 instance of the **context** that gets reused for each filter.  
* **Code Challenge:**  
	* Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.(This is trickier than it seems).
