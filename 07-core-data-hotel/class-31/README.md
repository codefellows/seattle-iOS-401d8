# Week 7 - Class 1
## Lab Assignment
* Download Parse Documentation to Dash.
* Get your project setup in Objective-C.
* Create a single view controller, that has a map view that takes up most the screen, and 3 buttons below it.
* The 3 buttons should set the region on the map view to 3 cool locations, you pick the locations.
* **Code Challenge:**
	* Implement Stack and Queue in Objective-C. You can implement them in the same project as your map app is in, since Objective-C does not support playgrounds.
