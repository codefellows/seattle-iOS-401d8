# Lab Assignment Submission Guide

## How Will Lab Assignments Be Submitted?
All lab assignments in the iOS 401 class will be submitted through a pull request to the appropriate _assignment repository_.  

Each week's Lab will have a unique repository with a README.md with the instructions for the assignment. Any special materials needed for the assignment will be included in the _assignment repository_.  

### For each week's lab assignment:
* You will fork the _assignment repository_
* Clone your fork onto your computer.
* Make a directory named with your name.
* **Do all of the work for the assignment in that directory.** As you work in your fork you will work in a branch that follows the naming convention `<YourName>-Class<#>`.
* When you are ready to submit your assignment you will make a pull request from the master-branch of your GitHub fork to the master-branch of the original Assignment.
* Then you will copy the url of your pull request and paste it into the assignment URL on Canvas.
    * Eg: `https://github.com/Codefellows-Seattle-iOS-401/Week1-Intro-to-Swift/pull/1`
