# Week 1 - Class 3
## Lab Assignment
* Using Playgroundsâ€¦
  * Declare `Identity` protocol with id `String`
  * Declare a `ToDo` class that has a text member of type `String`, and conforms to `Identity` protocol
  * Define `ObjectStore` protocol with these functions:` add(object:)`, `remove(object:)`, `objectAtIndex(index:)`, `count`, `allObjects`.
    * `ObjectStore` will need to have an array of `ToDo` objects to have access to.  
  * Create a `Store` class that will *conform* to `ObjectStore` protocol and implement required methods
  * Demonstrate using all the methods from `ObjectStore` protocol on the `Store`'s `ToDo` array.
